#Getting ExpressionEngine CMS to read markdown-files directly from the server

I asked the following [question](https://expressionengine.com/forums/topic/252997/import-markdown-files-as-entries-from-the-server) on the ExpressionEngine Forums a few months ago:

> Hi all,

> I'm writing a lot of ExpressionEngine related guides and content at the moment in Typora (a great markdown editor). Right now I have to copy/paste the text from Typora, into EE entries with a markdown formatted textarea field, and then publish.

> Is there any way I could have the markdown files on the server, and have them auto-update the entries? Exactly like Templates work, where you first create a template in EE, it's then available on the server as a file, and any changes made to this file is reflected on the site when you save.

Read the rest of my post and the replies, [on the ExpressionEngine Forums here...](https://expressionengine.com/forums/topic/252997/import-markdown-files-as-entries-from-the-server)

The general consensus was that this was a great idea, but no add-on with such functionality existed at the moment.

In the following months I thought about this a lot, but since I'm a web-developer and not a coder (not enough of a coder anyway) I couldn't create such an add-on myself. But some solution *had* to exist to make this possible — and it did!

After a lot of trial and error, I've found the following solution that works pretty well after you set it up. You can read all about it in the wiki via the links below:
